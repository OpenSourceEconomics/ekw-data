Documentation of structDataset!
===============================

We maintain this cleaned version of the `NLSY79`_ (:cite:`NLSY.2014`) dataset
(which can be found `here`_) to provide the empirical support for a variety of
projects related to computational aspects of estimating dynamic discrete choice
models.

We are very grateful to `Steve McClaskie
<mailto:steve.mcclaskie@chrr.osu.edu>`_ from the Center for Human Resource
Research for assisting us in navigating the intricacies of the data.
