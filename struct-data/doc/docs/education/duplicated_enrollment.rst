Duplicated Monthly Enrollment Data
----------------------------------

**Question**:

Often there exist two variables that indicate the enrollment data for a
particular month. Which variables do we have to pick?

**Answer** (answer from NLSY: :download:`PDF <../documents/correspondence_nlsy/nlsy_cps_job_occ_1978_monthly_enrollment.pdf>`):

Granted, the questionnaire looks like it is designed to re-ask respondents
about the same months collected in the subsequent interview.  However, the
instructions to the interviewer are to start with the month since the date of
the last interview.  It might be helpful to see the questionnaire.  For
example, go to page 3-15, questions 1 and 1A of the `1982 questionnaire`_.
For each respondent, the interviewers go into the interview with an
“Information Sheet” that has information on date of last interview, jobs, and
other information from the last interview to help drive the skips.
