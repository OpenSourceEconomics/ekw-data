===============

We maintain several benchmarking datasets for Eckstein-Keane-Wolpin models. They allow us to quickly assess the fruitfulness of possible improvements to the underlying economic model or its computational implementation in a well-known and empirically motivated setting. Please see the `documentation <https://ekw-data.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ for details.
