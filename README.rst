EKW data
********

We maintain several benchmarking datasets for Eckstein-Keane-Wolpin models. They allow us to quickly assess the fruitfulness of possible improvements to the underlying economic model or its computational implementation in a well-known and empirically motivated setting.

Career decisions data
*********************

We provide the original data set used by Keane & Wolpin (1997) in their seminal work studying the career decisions of young men. Please see this `notebook <http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ekw-data/blob/master/career-decisions/exploration.ipynb/>`_ for further details.

Eckstein-Keane-Wolpin data
**************************

We provide a cleaned version of the `National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79) <https://www.nlsinfo.org/content/cohorts/nlsy79>`_ to replicate and extend the data used by Keane and Wolpin (1997). Please see this `notebook <http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ekw-data/blob/master/struct-data/exploration.ipynb/>`_ for further details.
